While you may customize your new site's default "Redwood" theme, you may also want to start with an entirely blank theme.

**Create a new theme using the Statamic CLI:**

1. cd to the base level of your project:

        cd ~/Sites/statamin/

2. Enter the `php please` command to create your new theme:

        php please make:theme NEW_THEME_NAME
