# OLD AND MOVED INTO SEPARATE TOPICS

When you want to move into production, you'll need to create and run a web server. You have many different options when it comes to running Statamic in a production environment, and some implementations are more complex than others.

The instructions in this document detail one such option: Creating a web server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and assume that you already have a GCP account.

:::note
<p>CAUTION: These instructions require a paid account with Google Cloud Platform. Costs can add up quickly on cloud platforms, particularly with higher tier compute instances and other specialty services. Do not proceed unless you are already familiar and with comfortable with the costs of operating on a cloud provider.</p>
:::

#### Prerequisites

In order to successfully follow the instructions in this document, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* An active Google Cloud Platform subscription
* A local Development environment running Mac OS
* A production-ready Statamic website
* A GitHub account

## Create a Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine instance

GCP Compute Engines are virtual machines (VM) that run in the cloud. When you create a Compute Engine instance, it will be placed within logical and network groups associated with your project.

When you create and manage a web server at this level, you are working in the infrastructure level. That means your are using GCP as an **infrastructure as a service** provider.

**Perform the following steps to create a GCP Compute Engine instance that will become your production web server:**

1. Select the navigation menu in the upper left corner of the page:

  ![](/img/gcpNavMenu.png)

2. Select **Compute Engine** from the dropdown:

  ![](/img/gcpComputeEngine.png)

3. Select **CREATE INSTANCE** at the top of the **VM instances** page:

  ![](/img/gcpCreateInstance.png)

4. Configure, then create a new instance using the following guidelines:

    * **Name**: a descriptive name
    * **Region**: as close as possible to your target traffic sources
    * **Machine type**: f1-micro
    * **Boot disk**: standard persistent disk, 10GB, Debian
    * **Firewall**: Allow HTTP traffic, allow HTTPS traffic

## Create a key and add it to GCP

<!-- Web servers and GCP Compute Instances are networked at the IP level. This means that when you create a VM, it will be assigned an internal IP address, as well as a temporary public IP address. You can use the public IP address to connect to it  -->

<!-- Access to your VM is secured using something called the **AAA** network model. The **AAA** network model breaks down as:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Accounting -->

Authentication with your VM is established through the use of encrypted key pairs. Before you can connect to your VM from outside your cloud console, you must create and associate a key that identifies you.

There are two ways to manage your keys on GCP: You can use the [OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin/) Google service, or you can manage keys manually in the project metadata [manually](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys).

:::note
CAUTION: I strongly recommend following Google's advice and using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin/">OS Login</a> for production servers.
:::

**Perform the following steps to create a key pair and manually add a key to a GCP Project:**

1. Generate an RSA key pair, we'll use the default name for this one:

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

  This will create a public/private key pair, named "id_rsa" and place it in a hidden key directory on your Computer.

2. Change directories to your key directory:

    ```
    cd ~/.ssh
    ```

3. Using a text editor, copy the **public** key contents from "id_rsa.pub":

    ```
    atom id_rsa.pub
    ```

3. Navigate to the compute engine page of your GCP console:

  ![](/img/gcpComputeEngine.png)

4. Select **Metadata** from the navigation bar on the left side of the screen:

  ![](/img/gcpMetadata.png)

5. Select **SSH Keys**, then select the **Edit** button:

  <img class="imgOverrideSmall" src="/img/gcpSshEdit.png"/>

7. Select **+ Add item**:

  <img class="imgOverrideSmall" src="/img/gcpAddItem.png"/>

8. Paste your public key into the key text field in the Google Cloud console:

  <img class="imgOverrideSmall" src="/img/gcpPaste.png"/>

:::note
<p>NOTE: This process manually assigns fixed key access. I strongly recommend rotating your keys on a planned interval as part of your security policies. </p>
:::

9. Ensure your public key was properly added by connecting to your VM using secure shell (SSH):

  ```
  ssh username@serverIP
  ```

## Install web server dependencies:

Once you've created your GCP VM and enabled access by adding your key to the metadata, you can configure your VM as a web server. Just as with development, start configuration by installing dependencies.

**Perform the following steps to install dependencies on your GCP VM:**

1. Update the **apt** package manager:

  ```
  sudo apt update
  ```

2. Install Git:

  ```
  sudo apt install git
  ```

3. [Install php 7.3](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-php-7-3-on-debian-9-debian-8/)

## Configure PHP

1. Increase your php memory limits:

  1. Open the `php-memory-limits.ini` configuration file using vim:

      ```
      vim /usr/local/etc/php/7.3/conf.d/php-memory-limits.ini
      ```

  2. Find the
      ```
      ; Max memory per instance
      memory_limit = 128M
      ```
   configuration value, and change it to:

      ```
      ; Max memory per instance
      memory_limit = 256M
      ```

2. Change your php timezone:

  1. Open the `php.ini` configuration file using a text editor:

      ```
      vim /usr/local/etc/php/7.3/php.ini
      ```

  2. Comment out or delete the default value under `[Date]`, and add your own [timezone](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.america.php):

      ```
      [Date]
      ; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
      ; http://php.net/date.timezone
      date.timezone = America/Los_Angeles
      ```

## Add GitHub access to your VM

Just as you added your development computer to your GitHub repo, you must also add your GCP VM to GitHub. To do this, generate a new key pair on your VM and establish the public key with your GitHub repository.

**Perform the following steps to generate a key pair on your GCP VM:**

1. If you have not already done so, start an SSH session with your GCP VM:

    ```
    ssh user@yourVMip
    ```

2. Generate a private key on your server. This command will place a new key pair in the default location:

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

  In the Debian operating system, the default location is:

    ```
    /home/yourUserName/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

3. Exit your SSH session:

    ```
    exit
    ```

4. Download that public key file from your instance onto your local machine using SCP:

    ```
    scp -p user@yourVMip:/home/yourUserName/.ssh/id_rsa.pub id_rsa.pub
    ```
    :::note
    <ul>
    <li>
    The trailing “id_rsa.pub” determines what name your web server's public key file has on your local machine. You’ll also want to be in an appropriate directory when you issue the SCP command, it pulls it into your current directory.
    </li>
    <li>
    Some operating systems may hide and not display id_rsa.pub keys in file browsers. If you don't see your downloaded key, I recommend you check your directory location using the terminal command `ls`.
    </li>
    </ul>
    :::

**Add your VM public key to GitHub**

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository:

  ![](/img/deployKeyAddNavRepo.png)

2. Select "Settings":

  ![](/img/deployKeyAddSettingsPage.png)

3. Select "Deploy Keys" on the left menu:

  ![](/img/deployKeyAdd.png)

4. Open the public key you downloaded in the previous section of this documentation:

  ```
  atom id_rsa.pub
  ```

5. Copy the the key's text into the "Key" dialogue box, name your key, and select "Add key":

  <img class="imgOverrideTall" src="/img/deployKeyAddKeyText.png"/>

## Clone your repository into your web server

Once you've added your web server's key to GitHub, you can clone and pull from the repository onto your webserver. By default, the Debian operating system includes the Apache webserver. We'll use Apache to serve our websites to visitors.

**Perform the following steps to clone the repository containing your Statamic website into your web server:**

1. If you have not already done so, start an SSH session with your GCP VM:

    ```
    ssh user@yourVmIp
    ```

2. Clone your Statamic repository into the webroot, typically: "/var/www/html/", directory of your server:

  ```
  cd /var/www/html/

  git clone git@github.com:exampleUser/exampleRepo.git
  ```

  :::note
  IMPORTANT: You must use SSH syntax to clone a repository using a deploy key, HTTP syntax is unsupported.
  :::

Once complete, validate the clone operation by checking the folders under webroot. They should appear exactly as they do in your repository:

```
/var/www/html/exampleSite/
  ↳ assets/
  ↳ local/
  ↳ site/
  ↳ statamic/
  ↳ sample.htaccess
  ↳ index.php
  ↳ ..etc
```



<!-- ### PHP

By default, the Debian operating system only includes PHP version 7.0. Statamic requires PHP version 7.3. To further complicate matters, PHP 7.3 is not listed in the default Advnace Package Tool (`apt`) package manager. To install PHP 7.3 on Debian, we must first add it to the package manager, then install it.

**Perform the following steps to add PHP 7.3 to the `apt` package manager and install it**

1. Update `apt`:

  ```
  sudo apt update
  ```

2. Upgrade `apt`:

  ```
  sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```

3. Install dependencies:

  ```
  sudo apt -y install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates
  ```

4. Add PHP to the `apt` package manager keychain and package list:

  ```
  sudo wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg
  ```
  ```
  echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php7.3.list
  ```

5. Rerun apt update to fetch PHP 7.3 package data from the newly added package list:

  ```
  sudo apt update
  ```

6. Install PHP 7.3 using `apt`:

  ```
  sudo apt -y install php7.3
  ```

7. Validate your installation by checking your PHP version:

  ```
  php -v
  ``` -->

## Configure Apache

Statamic is capable of being served from many different web servers, most notably, Apache and NGINX. Debian includes a running Apache web server by default, so this document will provide instructions for Apache only.

**Perform the following steps to configure Apache on Debian to serve your Statamic site:**

1. If you have not already done so, start an SSH session with your GCP VM:

  ```
  ssh user@yourVmIp
  ```

2. Change to your webroot directory. The default webroot in Apache is `/var/www/html/`:

  ```
  cd /var/www/html/
  ```

3. Delete the default index page:

  ```
	sudo rm -rf index.html
  ```

4. Change to your site directory:

  ```
  cd /var/www/html/yourSiteName
  ```

5. Modify permissions, allowing the Apache "www-data" user to properly access and make changes to your website files:

  ```
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data site local statamic assets
  ```

6. Enable the sample "htaccess" file by removing the sample prefix:

  ```
	mv sample.htaccess .htaccess
  ```

7. Enable url rewriting:

	```
  sudo a2enmod rewrite
  ```

8. Restart Apache:

  ```
  systemctl restart apache2
  ```

## Create a new virtual host configuration

In Apache, the virtual host file allows you to specify multiple configuration parameters using individual configuration files which can then be selectively activated and deactivated when necessary. Since your installation uses a largely default configuration, your configuration file will not require much modification.

**Perform the following steps to create and activate a new virtual host configuration file for your Statamic site:**

1. In the terminal, change to the sites available directory:

  ```
  cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
  ```

2. Create a new virtual host configuration file for your Statamic site by copying the "000-default.conf" file. There isn't a strict naming requirement, but I recommend giving it the same name as your project folder:

  ```
  cp 000-default.conf exampleSite.conf
  ```

3. Using VIM, open your new .conf file:

  ```
  sudo vim exampleSite.conf
  ```

4. Append your site directory to the "DocumentRoot: /var/www/html/" configuration parameter:

  ```
  DocumentRoot: /var/www/html/exampleSite/
  ```

5. Save your configuration file with the following keystrokes:
  * `:w`
  * `:q`
  * `ENTER`

6. Enable your virtual host file using the `a2enmod` command:

  ```
  sudo a2ensite exampleSite.conf
  ```

7. Validate your configuration file by running the `apachectl` command with the `-t` option to check for syntax errors:

  ```
  sudo apache2ctl -t
  ```

8. Restart Apache to apply the new configuration:

  ```
  sudo apache2ctl restart
  ```
