<!-- # Guided sample works

## PX-Backup

I planned and wrote 100% of the PX-Backup documentation, which started with [version 1.0](1.0.backup.docs.portworx.com). For later releases, I interviewed and hired a new teachnical writer, who, under my guidance and following my style guide, carries the torch and continues to make contributions to PX-Backup documentation, which has now celebrated its [version 2.0](2.0.backup.docs.portworx.com) release at the time of this writing. 

### What I did

* Wrote all initial documentation
* hired a full-time writer specifically to contribute to this documentation
* continue to guide this documentation's growth as a manager

### What I'm proud of

* I single-handedly wrote the documenttion for this product's v 1.0 release alongside my ongoing Portworx Enterprise documentation commitments when Portworx was still just a startup
* I hired a fantastic new writer and watched them gain the skills and confidence to contribute to this document to standards I defined

## The rock paper scissors API

I conceived of an idea to create a permanent work sample that would showcase 3 things simultaneously:

* My technical writing abilities
* My programming abilities
* A concept for automating reference documentation

I succeeded on all three fronts: 

* I programmed a functional API that allows users to play rock paper scissors against a computer
* I placed a documentation endpoint in the API and wrote a script that generates reference documentation by calling the API and parsing the data it returns into my documentation
* I documented both the API and the reference automation mechanism as an example of software technical writing

### What I'm proud of

* The density of this accomplishment -- I did it all!
* I had an idea for content automation, and I brought it to life -->

This is where the sample works page will live. It's currently a markdown list, but I'd like to render values I point at it, see the jekyll template.
